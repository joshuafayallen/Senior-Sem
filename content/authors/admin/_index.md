For your final paper, you will choose, theorize, and assess a case of dissident citizenship, revolution, or resistance that we are not covering in class. Students will develop this paper in stages and will share/present their case to the class during the last several class sessions. Detailed directions will be provided separately.

**Project Proposal and Research Report (5%)**. You will first provide a brief proposal and research report. This will include 1) a description of the case, 2) the particular issues and themes the case raises and which you intend to address/develop, and 3) a preliminary list of sources to be used.

**Sharing Artifact/Presentation (10%)**. Near the end of the semester, you will share your case and research with the class via a presentation, a powerpoint, a website, a short video, or some other TBD method.

**Final Paper (15%)**. With the feedback from your sharing presentation, you will complete a final 8-10 page paper on your case, due the last week of the semester. 

**Grading Criteria**:  Your final project and final paper grades will be based on the thoroughness of your research, the quality of your argument, the persuasiveness and complexity of your analysis, and the clarity, style, and correctness of your writing.  Also see the information on writing assignments in the “ACADEMIC POLICIES” section below.  Late papers will incur a penalty of 1 letter grade per day
